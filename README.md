# Ensemble-Classifier

* Implemented a binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with Linear, Quadratic, and Radial Basis Function kernels.
* Implemented a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier for the Iris dataset using stochastic gradient descent optimization.
* Utilized the Forward selection method on the best model to identify the most influential features for classification.
* Utilized the Forward selection method on the best model to identify the most influential features for classification.
* Employed ensemble learning using the max voting technique, combining the above models. Evaluated the accuracy achieved by the
  ensemble model, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining multiple classifiers for improved prediction performance.
